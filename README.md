Creating a .exe file that 
1) turns off firewall 
2) opens up selected app
3) turns on firewall again once it detects that those apps are closed out.

Instructions:
1) create a text file in the same directory as the exe called paths.txt.
2) Paste your path into the paths.txt file. DO IT IN THIS FORMAT:
    a) NO QUOTES!
    b) Use "/" instead of "\" or "\\."

Current issues:
Some kinks i gotta work out when opening multiple programs.

Future plans:
1) I'll see what I can do with JSON files.
2) Nice interface?

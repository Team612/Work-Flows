Creating a .exe file that 
1) turns off firewall 
2) opens up the Driver's Station and other apps
3) turns on firewall again once it detects that those apps are closed out.

Current issues:
1) Adding an option for users to add a program to open instead of forcing them to edit the code and rebuild it.
2) Nice interface?

# 612 Workflows repo!
The point of this repository is to improve the 612 programmers' workflow.

For example, in one of the branches, we're testing .gitignore files. In another one, we're testing VSCode's GitHub extension.

The biggest project we're working on is comp.exe, which allows the Drive team to open up all the required programs at competition.
